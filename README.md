# UmojaHack
The proposed solution for the Umoja Hackathon,[The challenge](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/umojahack-3-hotspots) is to build a model to predict the burned area in different locations.

## About the solution
After reading the data and doing some data cleaning, data selection, adding new features, data visualisation, scaling and encoding, we created a model for each area and make the predictions for each area separately.

## Ranking
with this solution we could obtain the 6th place out 624 participants.  
you can find us [here](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/umojahack-3-hotspots/leaderboard) as a team neamed "OurTeam".
