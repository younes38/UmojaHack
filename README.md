# UmojaHack
The proposed solution for the Umoja Hackathon which was about AI.
## About the problem 
[The challenge](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/umojahack-3-hotspots) is to build a model capable of predicting the burned area in different locations.
## About the solution
After reading the data and doing some data cleaning, data selection, adding new features, data visualisation, scaling and encoding, we created a model for each area and make the predictions for each area separately.

## Ranking
with this solution we could obtain the 6th place out 624 participants.
